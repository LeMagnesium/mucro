A simple colored fileseeker for GNU/Linux

Use :
	mucro [-snq|filename] [-h] {-o filename}


	Mucro is a simple colored fileseeker for GNU/Linux, designed to be used
in a terminal only. It works like find, or whereis, that means it can give you
the exact place of a file/directory in or from your actual directory. It allows
you to write the output into a file, only seeks file with the exact name or
only among the files and directories in the actual one, etc...


TODO:
	Create the same program working for Windows.
