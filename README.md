Use :
	mucro {pattern} [-snqbt] [-h] [-o filename] [-r path]


Mµcro is a simple colored fileseeker for GNU/Linux, designed to be used
in a terminal only. It works like find or whereis in /usr/bin, that means it can give you
the exact place of a file/directory in or from your actual directory. It allows
you to write the output into a file, only seeks file with the exact name or
only among the files and directories in the actual one, etc...
Mµcro is a text-mode fileseeker, so it can be used on system without the server
X has to be up. That's why it has been done : easy to install, easy to use,
easy to modify, and useful.

TODO:
	Make the program work using Windows (and BSD).
